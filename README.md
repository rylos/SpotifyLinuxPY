# SpotifyLinuxPY

 SpotifyLinuxPY is a script that allows simplified installation and patching (using SpotX bash) for various distributions.

To run the script:
 ```
 git clone https://github.com/sayoridev/SpotifyLinuxPY
 cd SpotifyLinuxPY
 python3 SpotifyLinux.py -B
 ```

 Features that I have implemented so far:
 - [x] Initial Code
 - [x] Italian
 - [x] English
-  [ ] other language
 - [ ] Log file 
 - [x] Update in the script
 - [ ] a GUI (possibile feature)
 - [x] support for macOS and ChromeOS

for any other ideas write in the issues!

# SpotifyLinuxPY

 SpotifyLinuxPY is a script that allows simplified installation and patching (using SpotX bash) for various distributions.

For run the script:
 ```
 git clone 
 cd 
 python3 -B
 ```

 Features that I have implemented so far:
 - [ ] Initial Code
 - [ ] Italy o other leanguage
 - [ ] Log for choise and error
 - [ ] Update in the script
 - [ ] a GUI (possibile in a feature)
 - [ ] support for macOS
